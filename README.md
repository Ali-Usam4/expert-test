# üêû Bug Report & Fixes (July 2024)

## Summary
This project was reviewed for bugs in the Supabase functions, database schema, and frontend network calls. Below is a summary of the issues found and the fixes applied:

### Bugs Found & Fixed
- **Supabase Function (`send-confirmation/index.ts`)**
  - **Bug:** The OpenAI API response was accessed at `choices[1]` instead of `choices[0]`, causing most emails to have missing personalized content.
    - **Fix:** Changed to use `choices[0]` for the first (and only) response.
  - **Bug:** Missing validation for required environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `RESEND_PUBLIC_KEY`).
    - **Fix:** Added checks to throw clear errors if these are missing.
- **Frontend (`LeadCaptureForm.tsx`)**
  - **Bug:** The form called the `send-confirmation` function twice, resulting in duplicate emails for each submission.
    - **Fix:** Removed the duplicate call; now only one email is sent per submission.
- **Database Schema**
  - No issues found. The schema matches the frontend fields and supports the required functionality.

### Comments
- The frontend currently does not save leads to the database; it only sends a confirmation email. If you want to store leads, add a call to insert into the `leads` table via Supabase.
- All changes have been linted and verified.
