# Bug Report & Fix Summary (July 2024)

## Issues Found & Fixes Applied

### 1. Supabase Function (`send-confirmation/index.ts`)
- **Bug:** The function used `data?.choices[1]?.message?.content` to extract the OpenAI response, but the correct index is `0`. This caused most emails to have missing personalized content.
- **Fix:** Changed to `data?.choices[0]?.message?.content`.

### 2. Frontend (`LeadCaptureForm.tsx`)
- **Bug:** The form called the `send-confirmation` Supabase function twice, resulting in duplicate emails for every submission.
- **Fix:** Removed the duplicate call; now only one confirmation email is sent per submission.
- **Bug:** The frontend did not save leads to the database, only sent emails.
- **Fix:** Added a call to insert the lead into the `leads` table in Supabase before sending the confirmation email.

### 3. Database Schema
- The schema and policies for the `leads` table were correct and required no changes.
